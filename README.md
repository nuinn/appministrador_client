## About the Project

Tu Appministrador is a web application designed to assist administrators in managing incidents within residential communities.

  <li><strong>Structured Communication:</strong> Users report incidents via a form, which is reviewed by administrators before being made public, ensuring professional and sanitized communication.
<li><strong>Efficient Resource Allocation:</strong> The application suggests recommended service providers based on incident nature, allows assignment of providers to incidents, and maintains contact details for future reference.
<li><strong>User Notifications:</strong> Users can choose to receive notifications for all incidents or specific ones, ensuring timely updates without overwhelming users with unnecessary information.
<li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Administrators can track incident status through a progress stepper, updating users with relevant information at each stage.
