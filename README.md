## About the Project

Tu Appministrador is a web application designed to assist administrators in managing incidents within residential communities. Initially conceived to improve communication between administrators and homeowners/tenants, the project evolved to focus on incident management due to the prevalence of communication-related issues surrounding community problems.

Key features of Tu Appministrador include:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Centralized Incident Management:</strong> All incidents are recorded and managed within the application, providing a single point of reference for administrators.
  <li><strong>Structured Communication:</strong> Users report incidents via a form, which is reviewed by administrators before being made public, ensuring professional and sanitized communication.
<li><strong>Efficient Resource Allocation:</strong> The application suggests recommended service providers based on incident nature, allows assignment of providers to incidents, and maintains contact details for future reference.
<li><strong>User Notifications:</strong> Users can choose to receive notifications for all incidents or specific ones, ensuring timely updates without overwhelming users with unnecessary information.
<li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Administrators can track incident status through a progress stepper, updating users with relevant information at each stage.
</ul>
